For lab1, the first thing need to do is to install the flask on terminal, then
connect to CIS3210 which by using ssh username@cis3210.socs.uoguelph.ca on terminal,
then cd into the Lab1template folder, then use flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=18239
to run it. Then go to the website at cis3210.socs.uoguelph.ca:18239 (where 18239 is
my port number) to check if we get what we want. On the website, it has the title
"CIS*3210 Lab1" and with two buttons. When click on "GetArtsy", the links will show
action, and when click on "Arlet", it will pop up a small window. At the bottom of the
page there's my student name and id number.


For lab2, will be doing the same beginning steps as we did for Lab1. After running
flask on terminal, go to firefox and enter cis3210.socs.uoguelph.ca:18239 (where 18239 is
my port number), it shows four buttons on the page, which they are "Get", "Post", "Put",
"Delete". When you click on "Get" it returns the user info; when you click on "Post", it
creates user info; when you click on "Put", it updates the user info; when you click
on "Delete", it delete the user info.

For lab3, running the program the same steps as we did for lab1 and lab2. This lab we
have two text boxes for username and password, and the submit button. Once enter
the username and password, by clicking the submit button, it will pop up the arlet
saying that "success".

For lab4, running the program the same steps as we did for lab1. Once go into the the cis3210 server website, by entering the username and with correct password will login successfully. If not, it can create a new one into the database. Once it's login, it can also logout as well.
